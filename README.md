# Customer-Segmentation-through-RFM-Analysis
This project leverages RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on ABC Superstore's historical sales data (2014-2017) to rank customers based on purchasing behavior. Customers are segmented by RFM scores to help the business understand customer value and implement targeted marketing strategies.
